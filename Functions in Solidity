 Key points about functions
- Functions carry out a specific task.
- A function is a reusable code that can be called anywhere in your program.
- It satisfies the famous term in programming called "Don't repeat your code if you don't have to".
- It helps programmers in writing modular codes.
- Functions allow programmers to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.
